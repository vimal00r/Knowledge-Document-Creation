# ABSTRACT
The proposed method aims to revolutionize cross-referencing by utilizing Langchain and NLP techniques. The methodology centers on establishing crosslinkages between a primary document and its associated reference materials. At its core, the process involves the identification of reference IDs within the primary document and their substitution with the relevant content extracted from the reference documents. This innovative approach capitalizes on the diverse content types present in the input document, including text, images, flowcharts, and tables, all of which are efficiently converted into textual format. Subsequently, a cross linkage is generated, facilitating semantic and similarity searches across each segment in conjunction with its corresponding reference documents. By harnessing the capabilities of langchain, this novel application promises to offer an effective and accessible solution for document creation. The resulting system not only streamlines the process of creating cross-references but also enhances the accessibility and usability of research documents. Moreover, the project's contribution lies in its ability to establish robust linkages between research documents and their associated references, thereby enriching the scholarly discourse and facilitating further exploration of related topics. The proposed approach represents a significant advancement in the field of document management and scholarly research. By leveraging cutting-edge technology, it offers a scalable and efficient solution for cross-referencing, ultimately fostering greater connectivity and accessibility within the academic community.
